## About Me
*Hi! I'm Jamie Lim, a sophomore interested in computer science, math, and music technology. Iâ€™m curious about how computation and creativity intersect, from algorithms and systems to sound synthesis and design. Nice to meet you!*

Some fun facts about me:
1. My favorite animal is the hedgehog.
2. I used to play netball in my home country (Singapore); currently I kick people (and air) with the MIT Sport Taekwondo Club and dance with MIT Asian Dance Team.
3. I have 2 older sisters.
